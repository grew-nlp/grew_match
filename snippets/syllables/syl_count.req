% a Trick to count distribution of number of syllabes for a given word

pattern { 
  W [form=do]; 
  e: W -[Syl=*]-> S;
}

% The request (with clustering key "e.Syl") gives for each position, the syllabe position.
% But each syllabe of the same word is reported once for each syllable
% For instance, for the form "do", the request returns: 1 --> 770 occurrences, 2 --> 3 occurrences
% This means that there are 3 cases with 2 syllabes and 767 cass with exacly 1 syllable (767 = 770 - 3).
