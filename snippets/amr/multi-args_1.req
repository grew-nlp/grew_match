% Search for a node which is the source of the 3 relations ARG0, ARG1 and ARG2
% The matching algorithm implies that X0, X1 and X2 are 3 distinct nodes.
% A solution where X0 = X1 is not found by this pattern.
% See next snippet for a way to do this

pattern {
	X -[ARG0]-> X0;
	X -[ARG1]-> X1;
	X -[ARG2]-> X2;
}
