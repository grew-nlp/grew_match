% It is possible to request the presence of an incoming edge with the "*" symbol.
% In the example below, only occurrences of the verb "make" with an incoming edge `root` are returned

pattern { X [ upos=VERB, lemma="make"]; * -[root]-> X; }

% Warning: the clause "* -[root]-> X" is not equivalent to the clause "Y -[root]-> X":
% The first is just an additional constraint, the second matches a new node `Y`.
