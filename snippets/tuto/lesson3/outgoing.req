% It is possible to request the presence of an outgoing edge with the "*" symbol.
% In the example below, only occurrences of the verb "make" with an outgoing subject edge are given

pattern { N [ upos=VERB, lemma="make"]; N -[nsubj]-> *; }

% Warning: the clause "N -[nsubj]-> *" is not equivalent to the clause "N -[nsubj]-> X":
% The first is just an additional constraint, the second matches a new node "X".
