% It is possible to request the presence of an outgoing edge with the "*" symbol.
% In the example below, only occurrences of the verb "make" with an outgoing subject edge are given

pattern { X [ upos=VERB, lemma="make"]; X -[nsubj]-> *; }

% Warning: the clause "X -[nsubj]-> *" is not equivalent to the clause "X -[nsubj]-> Y":
% The first is just an additional constraint, the second matches a new node `Y`.
